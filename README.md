## [Progressive International](https://progressiveinternational.netlify.com)

Public website for Progressive International.

#### Key tech

The deployed website is a static site generated by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), styled with [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org/) and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for explicit CSS, and written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Relies on [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for development, preferably installed via [Node Version Manager (`nvm`)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

#### Development

- **Initial install**: `yarn` to dl/build package dependencies (prefer `node@^11`)
- **Dev deploy**: `npm run start` to... - deploy the website with hot-reload on edit, exposed to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) - deploy the serverless functions for Stripe payments etc., exposed to [http://localhost:9000/.netlify/functions/test/](http://localhost:9000/.netlify/functions/test/)
- **Prod deploy**: Commit to `master` branch and push to [GitHub](https://github.com/commonknowledge/website) to auto-deploy a new production version to https://commonknowledge.coop

#### Infrastructure
